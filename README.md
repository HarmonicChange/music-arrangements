# Random Collection of Music

I've played piano since I was little and still do today. I've also arranged a few pieces for various groups I've played in. This repository contains all the music I've found or arranged during my musical journey. All files are available in [MuseScore](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore), a free open-source software for music notation, and available in PDF format.

I do not claim credit for piece composition and will do my best to give credit for the people who made the sheet music or composed the piece. That said, if I didn't give you credit, please contact me and I will update with your information.
